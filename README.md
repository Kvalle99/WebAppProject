## File organisation: 
The project are split into three main sections. These are server-side, client-side and documentation. 

### **Server-Side:**
In the Server folder you can find the src-folder with all code related to the server side. This is further split into
Model, Router, Service and Test folder with its corresponding typescript files.
 
### **Client-Side:** 
The Client-folder contains a corresponding src-folder for all client-side code. This is further split into Components, Images and Views.
The tests for client side code are placed next to its corresponding code file, E.g the tests for the Activity Card are placed in the same components folder as the Activity Card class.
